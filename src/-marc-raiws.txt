REDUNDANT ARRAY OF INEXPENSIVE WEB SERVERS
==========================================

Goal
====

Make a web system hosting multiple sites on multiple locations. All locations work together in serving the web sites, balancing load and sharing backups. Web sites contain different data but cooperate in a federation where they share data and resources.


Notes:
- distribute backups using (modified) p2p/torrent protocols
- failover: start a site & load backup from network
- distribute processing (image resizing, email decoding etc) to low load machines
- federate content
- pubsub for distributing updates
- backup/store files on cloud systems (s3, greenqloud, etc)


Federation:
- shared logons/ authentication
- share/distribute content
- pubsub for cooperation


Every server needs:
- PolderCast for distributed PubSub
- Bittorrent for distributing backups and other big backups
- DNS server for failover and location handling


Misc:
- Upload files using dropbox
